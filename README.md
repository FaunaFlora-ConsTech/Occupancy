This script will run the single-season single species occupancy model (SSOM) of MacKenzie et al., 2002 (Ecology) using the unmarked package. The data comes from a transect survey in Sapo National Park, Liberia. I do not have permission to share data. However, if you know how to construct a detection history matrix of species detection/nondetection, then this script should work without any glitches. A useful way to understand how the input data are formatted is to refer the package manual. A bonus here is I have also included codes to compare predictions from a glm() function without accouting for imperfect detection.In the future, I will upload simulation scripts to compare the predictive ability of SSOM and glm. Lookout for it!
